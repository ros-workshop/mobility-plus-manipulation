# mobility-plus-manipulation

## Goal

In this session, you'll make use of the navigation and manipulation modules you worked on in 
this week to perform a task: Navigating to a set of waypoints where your robot would find
an object of interest to collect.

## Task Description

You'll be using the Husky with ABB arm mounted on it from the 
[manipulation topic](https://github.com/ros-workshop/manipulation) yesterday, that will navigate to known waypoints and perform the task of
 
* Picking up a cube-object with AprilTag attached on its sides, and
* Dropping the cube-object on the robot's back.
